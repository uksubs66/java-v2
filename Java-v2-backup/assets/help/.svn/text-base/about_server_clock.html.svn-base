<title>About the server clock</title>
<div class="sub_instructions">
    <p>This clock represents the actual server time as closely as possible.</p>
    
    <p>The time being displayed could vary from the time being
        reported by your computer as the clock is representing the ForeTees server time and not your computer's 
        local time.</p>
</div>
<div class="main_instructions">
    <p>This clock can be used to monitor the actual time on the ForeTees server 
        so that you will know precisely when the next day will become available to make reservations.</p>

    <p>For instance, if the current server time is 6:58:12 AM and next Saturday is not available 
        (is not green on the calendar), but it will become available at 7:00 AM, 
        you can watch the clock until it gets to 7:00:00 AM.  
        At that time you can simply click on the day in the calendar even though it is not yet green.</p>
    
    <p>If needed, you can refresh the calendars by clicking on the 'Refresh Calendars' or 
        'Refresh Page' link under the clock.</p>
