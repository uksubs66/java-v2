        <p>You are currently using ForeTees' new "Mobile" interface.  You may have selected it when logging in to ForeTees, 
            or your club may have chosen to use this new interface as a default for your device.</p>
        <p>While this interface is called "Mobile", it is designed to operate on a wide variety of modern devices, 
            including tablets, phones, laptop and desktop computers.</p>
        <p>If your club has chosen to keep the previous "Desktop" view enabled, you should find a link for 
            "Switch to Desktop View" at the bottom of every page.  Clicking that link should return you the previous interface.</p>

    <div class="sub_instructions pageHelp" data-fthelptitle="Navigation seems slow">
        <p>Performance of ForeTees should be acceptable if you are using a tablet or phone built in the last 2 years, 
            or a personal computer built in the last 5 years.</p>
        <p>If you are using a device fitting the above criteria, yet ForeTees is unacceptably slow, 
            please review the following:</p>
        <p>Slow network performance can give the appearance of a slow device or application.  Please check that 
            your mobile or wireless network is working well.</p>
        <p>Viruses or malware can substantially impact the performance of your device.  Please make sure your system 
            has been cleared of all malicious software. Please note that tablets and mobile phones are susceptible 
            to viruses, just like personal computers.</p>

    <div class="sub_instructions pageHelp" data-fthelptitle="What are 'TIME OUT' or 'UNABLE TO LOAD PAGE' errors?">
        <p>These errors are usually the result of a configuration issue in Microsoft Internet Explorer.</p>
        <p>If you are using the Internet Explorer browser and are seeing these errors while using ForeTees, please try the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Close all Internet Explorer and Windows Explorer windows that are currently open.</li>

            <li>Open Internet Explorer by clicking the Start button. In the search box, type Internet Explorer, 
                and then click Internet Explorer.</li> 

            <li>Click the Tools button, and then click Internet options.</li>

            <li>Click the Advanced tab, and then click Reset.<br> 
                <b>DO NOT check the Delete Personal Settings box</b>, since checking this box will delete all favorites 
                and stored passwords.</li>

            <li>In the Reset Internet Explorer Settings dialog box, click Reset.</li>

            <li>When Internet Explorer finishes applying default settings, click Close, and then click OK.</li>

            <li>Close Internet Explorer.<br>
                Your changes will take effect the next time you open Internet Explorer.</li>
